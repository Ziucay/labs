# Best practices

- Added 30 minutes timeout instead of 6 hours by default
- Restricted permission for contents to read only
- Added cache for maven dependencies to make builds faster
- I decided to make workflow sequential, as setting up new runner takes
    more time than being optimized with parallel run
